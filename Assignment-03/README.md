# What is Compound Ai system ?
Compund Ai is a collection of different ai model , finding solution of complex and critical problem .compound AI systems combine various models, retrievers, databases, and external tools to enhance performance, flexibility, and robustness .
Single models often struggle with complex, real-world problems. Compound AI systems address this by breaking down problems into smaller, manageable components.

# What is Ai Agent ?

An AI agent is a software program or system designed to perform tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence (AI). These agents can perceive their environment, make decisions based on that perception, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

# What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents ?

## AI Agents
An AI agent is a singular entity designed to perform specific tasks autonomously. It can perceive its environment, make decisions, and act based on those decisions. Examples include chatbots, recommendation systems, and autonomous robots.

## Compound AI Systems
A Compound AI system is a more complex setup that involves the integration of multiple AI agents or subsystems, often working together to achieve broader or more complex objectives. These systems combine the capabilities of various agents or models, each specializing in different tasks, to solve a problem that is too complex for a single agent to handle effectively.

#What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG ?

## Fine-Tuning: 
Adjusts an existing AI model by training it on a specific dataset, refining it to perform better on particular tasks or with specific types of data. fine-tuning is not a easy task . it taking a long time period .

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
 Combines a base AI model with a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant external information to generate more accurate and context-specific responses during inference. it's based on a specific topic and for specific task . RAG ( provide external date to a Ai model)
